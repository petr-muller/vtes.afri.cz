    Road to Pulled Fang is a Czech series of local tournaments that seed
    a special final game to be played during the Pulled Fang tournament.
    The fifth tournament of the series was held in my home city of Brno. I
    played the Infernal Princes of Anarchy deck blatantly copied from TWDA
    without great success, earning just a single victory point.

Road to Pulled Fang is a Czech series of local tournaments that seed a special
final game to be played during the Pulled Fang tournament. The fifth and final
tournament of the series was held in Brno.

In contrast to the previous years when the Brno prince held the tournament at
his house (with an outdoor terrace, swimming pool and two giant cats), this year
we had the Brno tournament in the local game store, [Rishada](https://www.rishada.cz/turnaje).
Unfortunately, we had to share the venue with the Magic: the Gathering tournament
(the Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate prerelease). which made the
space pretty crowded and almost without fresh air, especially later in the
afternoon.

# Deck: Infernal Princes of Anarchy 

After the [disappointing performance]({{< ref "/tournaments/20220519-road-to-pulled-fang-04" >}} "4th Road to Pulled Fang #11")
on the last tournament where I played the Enkidu Block deck, I wanted to play
something more aggressive and straightforward. Though, in contrast to my currently
beloved [Banu Haqim bruise bleed]({{< ref "/decks/20220109-banu-haqim-legacy" >}} "Banu Haqim Legacy"),
maybe something less janky and with a chance to actually win something üôÉ. None
of my existing decks felt right, so I perused [Codex of the Damned archetypes](https://codex-of-the-damned.org)
for ideas. The [Hidden Royalty](https://codex-of-the-damned.org/en/archetypes/neonate/hidden-royalty.html)
list is something I wanted to try several times already, but I eventually
went with the Bram van Stappen's [Infernal Princes of Anarchy](https://www.vekn.net/forum/event-reports-and-twd/79467-twd-belgian-national-championship-2021-brussels-6-11-2021)
deck, mostly because I like the highly optimized library with recursion. Also,
I like playing decks without Dominate. I was missing one Arishat, so I borrowed
one from Karel, and I also did not have nine spare Ashur Tablets, so I needed to
loot them from the Enkidu Deck. That is why I use identical sleeves on all decks,
I can easily just move cards between them.

Playing a deck on the tournament without ever playing it before is not really
optimal. Although this showed a bit during the tournament, the deck is quite
easy to play: aggressively get out (at least) three titled vampires (in
the ideal case, one Prince, one Baron and one Arishat), start beating people
with Parity Shifts and finish them with Reckless Agitations. Filter the hand
with Dreams of the Sphinx and later bring back the necessary cards with Ashur
Tablets.

I was a bit worried about the defensive capabilities against aggressive decks.
I toyed with the idea of tuning the deck slightly, adding Bait and Switch, but
in the end I decided not to mess with the deck I never played.

# Games

## Game 1: 1VP

Marionette Bleed (H≈ôebi) ‚ÜíÔ∏è Salubri Marionette (Ondra) **3VP GW** ‚ÜíÔ∏è me 1VP ‚ÜíÔ∏è Inner Circle (Faldys) ‚ÜíÔ∏è Gangrel Combat (Martin)

I had a reasonable crypt with a prince, baron and Arishat. I started fast with
a prince first and started chaining shifts. Faldys had Mistress Fanchon, but I
brought out Arishat, so I had a vote lock and used it. The Marionettes were 
depriving me of blood, but I somehow managed with the help of the Coven.

Unfortunately, grandpredator played a similar thing as my predator, but decided
not to contest. Additionally, he suffered in combat with his Gangrel predator.
In the middle of the game he also made a mistake: he paid two pool for a master
on a minion, then played an inferior Magic of the Smith while having Millicent.
Of course, his Gangrel predator was able to block it and the vampire burned. All
this leaves my predator without any significant pressure.

With the help of some subobtimal decisions by my prey about what mine minions to
borrow and steal their blood, I managed to oust Faldys by chaining a Parity Shift
and two Reckless Agitations for twelve in total. My hand was a little stuck after
that, though, and I did not have a good follow-up. I had an Ancilla Empowerment
which would get my prey to two pool, but I lacked the finisher. I would end
at seven pool myself, which I considered too risky. I was severely missing blood
on minions and my hand sucked. That is what Dreams of the Sphinx are for, but I
saw none during the whole game. When I finally got one, my predator played one
first. I tried to fuck around; I did some actions and played some masters, but
without blood I died rather quickly. Grandprey died shortly after. The Gangrel
manages to defend longer than I expect but eventually dies too.

This game was a bit bittersweet. It feels like I should have managed more. On 
one hand, I had a vote lock and managed to have reasonable game until quite late
into the game. I think there was a one or two turn window after I ousted my
first prey where I could have used the momentum while there was time, if only I
had some ousting cards in hand. On the other hand, being seated in front
of the blood deprivation deck really hurts the deck: it can be quite blood-hungry
with the Reckless Agitations and Arishats special. It feels like the deck could
use another blood-gaining tech (Jake Washington maybe?).

## Game 2: 0VP

Ministry Multi-Act (Dan) 3VP GW ‚ÜíÔ∏è Kiev Circle (ƒå√≠k) 1VP ‚ÜíÔ∏è DOM OBF S/B (Pe≈•ko) ‚ÜíÔ∏è me

Another stealth bleed as a predator, so I was pretty pissed off. But at least I
had a game in this one. I had an Enkidu with two Raven Spies fairly fast, and I
had more reactions than in the last game, so at least I was able to keep at the
table. I played on the edge, keeping six pool on Matasuntha in the uncontrolled
region, hoping to eventually bring her out when I would have got a `Villein`. I
beat some vampires on both sides, and the state felt quite manageable. 
On the other side of the table, ƒå√≠k was slowly being ground down. He went
for a lunge, and Pe≈•ko deflected the last ousting bleed for three. I had
a `Direct Intervention` and canceled the `Deflection`, killing Pe≈•ko (who was very
likely to kill me in his turn). The table state looked manageable, both players
had vampires just with little blood, but Dan killed ƒå√≠k fast, using a `Reckless
Agitation` that went 1 to ƒå√≠k and 5 to me. I was not able to block that despite
the two Ravens. He then had enough stealth to kill me, too, unfortunately.

This game was a bit unfortunate. The stealth-bleeding predator did enough damage
to me that I could not properly set up and buffer my pool with Villeins.
With more pool and a second vampire, I think I would have a chance to eventually
wear the Ministry down relatively fast. Still, with that much damage, it only
took two actions to kill me.

## Game 3: 0VP

Ministry Nakthorheb S/B (Ma≈•o) ‚ÜíÔ∏èÔ∏è me ‚ÜíÔ∏èÔ∏è Alexandra ‚ÜíÔ∏è Ivan Krenyenko DOM (Karel)

Third round, third stealth bleed as a predator. This time a one with block
denial by corruption counters. I had a nice crypt, and this time `Aksinya` showed
up, so I thought I had a chance. I had a reasonably equipped Enkidu with two
spies and a lot of pool because my prey played an `Ancient Influence`. I fucked
around a bit and started to feel quite good. My predator was bled for a lot,
and I was even beginning to plan how I should navigate the resulting three-player
game.

I had fourteen pool, untapped Aksinya, one untap, and a combat-heavy hand
with `Infernal Pursuit`. Prey played `Parity Shift` after draining himself with
`Zillah‚Äôs Valley`, so I decided to spend the untap and pay two pool for
`Aching Beauties`. I relied on seeing seven cards in the combat that I expected
to give me more defense, and at worst, I have the Aksinya. I managed to stop
the Parity Shift but drew no further defense. Instead, I finally got a `Villein`
and a third `Ashur Tablet`, so I thought I should be fine in my round. But then
the Ministry tapped my Aksinya, and I knew I was in trouble. First, I got bled
for seven, then two more, and finally, I got hit by `Enticement`. GGs. Maybe if I
had not blocked the Parity Shift, I would survive, but who knows.

# Overall


Of course, I‚Äôm pretty disappointed about the result. It is easy to dismiss it
as a result of poor seating and bad luck, but that is how it felt; basically,
nothing went right, and the deck felt unusually clunky. Three times, being
seated in front of an aggressive stealth bleed deck definitely does not help.
I often missed cards that I needed to play smoothly, such as Villeins and wakes
or untaps.

It is somehow challenging for me to predict the metagame in Czech tournaments;
it seems to change a lot between the events. In the last tournament, everybody
played heavy combat, this time, the meta was fast and aggressive. And I somehow
manage to bring a ‚Äúwrong‚Äù deck everywhere.
