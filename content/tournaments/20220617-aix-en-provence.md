    Finally, the Grand Prix is back after getting canceled two years in a row
    (fuck COVID). After missing the (announced late and too remote) tournament
    in Hyvinkää, Finland, I traveled to Aix-en-Provence. I played a sweet
    multiact Ministry deck to a disappointing result of 0VP after contesting
    Ministry in all three games and being on the wrong end of multiple
    table-splitting deals.

## Game 1: 0VP

Stanislava →️ Political Giotto (Vincent) →️ Rachel Madness Network →️ V5 Ministry S/B →️ me

My predator discarded an `Enchanting Gaze` soon, and I knew we would likely be
contesting. We quickly discussed what we would be playing, so we would not end up
contesting an identical first vampire. Fortunately, he had `Faruq Abd al-Qadir`,
while I had `Nonu Dis`. I influenced out one of the five caps, and my predator
brought out `Crystal Lynn`. I also had her in my uncontrolled region, so I needed
to decide whether to influence her out to contest. I figured out that contesting
the vampire would likely be better pool-wise because the Ministry will simply
just bleed a lot anyway. We kept contesting for the rest of the game.

My decision to contest Crystal Lynn with my predator leaves me with barely any
pressure. Still, with just two vampires, I could not bleed sufficiently to kill
my prey, who bloated with `Villein` and `Govern the Unaligned`. Vincent
emerged as a table superpower quite soon, which at least meant I could bleed
without fear; Vincent had barely any pressure.

The votes were crazy on the table. I had two barons. My prey had `Ingrid Rossler`
and muted `Stanislava`. Vincent had `Arika` and grandprey had `Rachel Brandywine`.
This meant there was a lot of talk about random politics, but nobody had a clear
lock, so we did not have many political actions actually passing. I eventually
tried to oust via a `Reckless Agitation` after making a deal with my grandprey,
but it did not pass because of a discarded political card. After that, Vincent
made a deal with my prey where he would oust three players and then leave two
VPs to my prey. Teaming up, this happened relatively fast, serving as a gentle
introduction into the world of French 3/2 tablesplit deals I would see in later
games.
