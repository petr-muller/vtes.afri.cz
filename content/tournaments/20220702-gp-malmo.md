## Game 1: 0VP

Presence Weenies **4VP GW** →️ Toreador Starter →️ Malkavian Starter **1VP** →️ Ventrue Stickmen →️ me

My predator was very fast with `Lodin` up via `Dreams of the Sphinx`. I had
`Nonu Dis` as a first guy, but my hand was very awkward: some masters I had to
play before I could get blood from Noni. I mostly drew stealth cards, with just
a single `Platinum Protocol` and `CrimethInc.`, which I hoped would get things
going. My prey played a `Mind Numb` on me before I had a chance to bleed, which
slowed me down. My predator bled me for six as his first action, which I could not
block. This meant that I could only bring out two vampires instead of three.

I realized I would need a Baron if I was supposed to survive because I was
also likely to receive bounced Malkavian bleeds by Malkavian. I had no Barons in
my uncontrolled region, so I tried to play as many cards as possible to
cycle to some `Fee Stakes`. It started to show that my crosstable allies are very green
("playing with checklists" green), which did not really help the balance on the
table. Toreador was under weenie pressure. Malkavian bled forward, but she got
blocked and hit by Stickmen often.

Toreador was down to two pool, so the Ventrue tried to keep him alive and passed
a `Parity Shift` moving three pool from my prey to the Toreador. I was also
getting bled but not by full force; I am unsure whether my predator just wanted
me to do more damage forward, or he did not have the cards. He pulled out a fourth
vampire as the only unlocked one. I still tried to go forward; my prey was at eight,
so in theory, I could oust him with enough cards (with `Club Illusion`, I had a
bleed for five on the board), but I only had stealth and bounces, and I only drew
politics and more stealth. My prey ousted the Toreador in his turn but, more
importantly, `Mind Numbed` the only unlocked Ventrue, who also received one
redirected bleed. Turns out that he did not have any wakes or unlocks, so he dies
with three `Deflections` in his hand. So I got one more turn, but now my prey had
more pool. I drew more cards I could not play, so I could not kill him.
He then swept the Malkavian, and I just conceded.

Having slept for only three or four hours two nights before, I was sleep deprived,
and I made a million stupid mistakes in this game: I kept forgetting to discard,
I forgot that `Nonu Dis` has +1 bleed, and I even forgot to use his special. I
had to compensate by trying to focus hard in the remaining games. The rest of the
day was better, but I think I could have done better if I had focused better
in the first game.
