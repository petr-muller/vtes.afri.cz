In the middle of summer, the Brno prince held a friendly little tournament, so
it was almost mandatory to participate. Unfortunately, I was leaving for a
solitary hike the next day. And after a crazy week at work, I had very little
time and needed to do some shopping and preparation after the tournament. Like
usual, I did not prepare at all and just took one of the tournament-capable
decks I already have. It is certainly not a good practice.

# Summary

The tournament had the usual structure: three rounds and finals. There were
fifteen players, so we had three five-player tables. I played the AUS OBF Black
Hand deck. My record was 0GP 3VP, which somehow miraculously placed me in fifth
place. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to play the finals, so I had to
yield my seat.

# Deck: AUS OBF Black Hand

Over time, I played many flavors of Black Hand decks. I like aggressive decks,
so I had the most fun playing the Assamite multi-act bloating deck with Losses.
I played it in several tournaments, and although it is fun to play, I did not
like how the deck does not really have a plan B and how vulnerable the deck is
to permanent intercept. It is relatively easy to shut down a survival strategy
based on undirected action bloat with permanent intercept because it forces you
to use stealth cards, a finite resource better used for offense.

The variant with AUS makes the deck more resilient by providing bounces, and the
ability to block undesirable actions. The major vampires (Karif and Elimelech)
both have `+1 strength`, helping in combat. I have also found the AUS deck using
less blood than the QUI one. The crypt (like usual for Black Hand) is quite
sub-optimal; one needs to play sub-par vampires to fill the ranks (Claudia,
Rashid, Al-Muntathir). Hagar Stone is surprisingly good. I'd like to write a
separate article about this deck.
