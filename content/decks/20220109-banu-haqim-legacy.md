  Like many people, Haqim's Law: Retribution caught my eye during the Banu Haqim 5th edition preconstructed deck
  previews. Turning all your combat cards into +1 bleed modifiers when you do not need them is a powerful effect. People
  jumped to try building the new Banu Haqim with Blood Sorcery, a pretty potent combat discipline on its own. I always
  liked the Quietus combat, which can be super-punishing and unpredictable, but the problem is that it was always tough
  to make such a deck able to oust. With Haqim's Law: Retribution, the obvious thing to try building is a bruise bleed.
  Because of the new Banu Haqim master, the deck can play many combat cards without being afraid the cards will get
  stuck in my hand, and we can use them to either punish blockers or make our bleeds more powerful. The quietus/celerity
  package is very versatile and can exploit weak spots of other combat decks.

Like many people, `Haqim's Law: Retribution` caught my eye during the Banu Haqim 5th edition preconstructed deck
previews. Turning all your combat cards into `+1 bleed` modifiers when you do not need them is a powerful effect.
It removes a significant obstacle in playing combat cards together with other deck strategies: you need to get into
combat to play your cards. Otherwise, they get stuck in your hand, and you need to discard them. So traditionally, you
either needed ways to cycle cards your cards via discards, play rushes to reliably enter combats, or become a wall deck.
People jumped to try building the new Banu Haqim with Blood Sorcery, a pretty potent combat discipline on its own.
I always liked the Quietus combat, which can be super-punishing and unpredictable, but the problem is that it was always
tough to make such a deck able to oust.

So with `Haqim's Law: Retribution`, the obvious thing to try building is a bruise bleed. Quietus and Banu Haqim have
a reasonable bleed capability with `Loss` and `Khabar: Glory`, and `Haqim's Law: Retribution` supports that nicely.
Because of the new Banu Haqim master, the deck can play many combat cards without being afraid the cards will get stuck
in my hand, and we can use them to either punish blockers or make our bleeds more powerful. The quietus/celerity package
is very versatile and can exploit weak spots of other combat decks.

The legacy group 2/3 Banu Haqim can afford to run an efficient crypt of midcaps. I think the deck cannot afford to run
high-capacity vampires without good multi-act and limited defense or bloat capacity. The primary vampires are
5 and 6 capacities with both main disciplines on superior, helped by `Parnassus`, a seven cap. Beyond these, the vampire
quality drops quite a lot: the deck could really use a `QUI cel` four cap: `Parmenides` makes a good impression,
but the punishment for a predator draining him of all blood with a `Villein` is severe.

## Ousting

I want to consistently bleed for 2+ with at least two vampires, ideally three or more. I can bleed for more when the
situation allows, but this needs reading the game well so that the precious dedicated bleed cards are not wasted
into a `Deflection`. When the prey attempts to block, I will punish him with combat and beat him down. I am not afraid
of completely crippling the prey even quite early: the deck should be able to oust a completely torporized player quite
fast with cards like `Loss` and `Haqim's Law: Retribution`. I will try to manipulate the board state to hit the jackpot
with `Khabar: Glory`, but I will not bend over backward to do so. The deck runs enough combat cards for me to not think
twice about discarding them into `Haqim's Law: Retribution`, but I need to think about which ones to discard and which
ones to keep for possible future combats.

## Survivability

The deck does not defend that well. The medium capacity crypt does not pressure my pool too much, though, and a bit
of bloat with `Haqim's Law: Leadership` and `Vessel`s helps survive. The deck is aggressive, so I want to ride the wave
of pool gained via ousting, boosted by `Khabar: Glory` whenever possible.

Untapping with `Black Sunrise` helps defend against decks that do not use much stealth. I am not afraid of crippling
or even burning my predator's vampire when given the opportunity unless my grand predator is even more aggressive. I can
also threaten other players with combat to talk them out of actions that I dislike.

## Likes

Preys that skate around the 10-12 pool without too much bloat. Slower predators. I should not mind running into most
wall decks. The quietus combat versatility should exploit their weaknesses because most decks rely on a single combat
defense strategy such as maneuvers or combat ends.

## Risks

The deck is still hairy and needs more tuning: right now, it is essentially a Banu Haqim pile. The versatility
of the combat package can also result in not having the right answers at the right time, especially if I made wrong
decisions earlier and discarded combat cards that would have their use later in the game.

Large bleeds are vulnerable to deflections. I need to pay attention to potential targets' pool health to avoid ousting
the wrong player. Compared to stealth bleed decks, the bruise bleed keeps its support cards for future bleeds, which is
a good thing.

The deck has a poor defense against aggressive and hard-hitting predators, which means in some games, the seating will
be poor enough for me to be ousted quickly without any means to do something about it.

The deck’s offensive combat capabilities are good, but defense not so much. Meeting another combat can lead to
a lose-lose situation where both sides cripple their vampires without gaining any advantage on either side.

I would expect the deck to behave and play similarly to the Animalism weenie but worse because of consistency. It will
be able to have better bleeds and better combat both but not all the time because of the card variance. The main
differentiator is the lack of recursion via `Ashur Tablets` that `Nana Buruku` gives to the animalism deck; if this deck
had that tech, it would potentially be much stronger.

## Early Game

I should be able to influence out a vampire in the second round pretty much all the time. I should avoid influencing out
`Parmenides` as a first or second vampire if possible; the risk of getting drained by `Villein` is too high. I want
three vampires out: `Abd al-Rashid` and `Jalal Sayad` are the best: I want at least of them, but if I can have both,
that is even better. `Parnassus` or `Enam` (in this order) can replace one of them. The four caps play a supporting
role.

I do not want my prey to stop spending their pool too soon, so I try to observe the early signals for bloat (big caps,
political weenies, `The Unnamed`) and start being aggressive as soon as I spot them. These decks rarely overextend, so
there is no point in waiting. If my prey does not seem to bloat too much, and I can afford it, I avoid putting too much
pressure early and focus on setting up (`Retain the Quick Blood`, `Haqim's Law: Leadership` and the retainers) instead.
The point is to not intimidate the prey from influencing their third vampire and getting into the 12-ish pool territory.

## End Game

I do not have table-shaping capabilities, so I expect the deck play mostly as a Malkavian stealth-bleed, just
with kicking down vampires instead of stealth. If possible, focus the resources on shutting down important minions
first, but unfortunately the deck will not be able to choose that often.

## Ideas

- Find a way to recurse with `Ashur Tablets`: maybe two `Parthenons` and three sets of `Ashurs` would be enough? 
  The deck does not need to play that many masters anyway.
- The combat package definitely needs to be fine-tuned. The initial version is mostly a pile of combat cards that felt
  good, but the size, cards and counts are very likely to be entirely different in an optimal build.
- The deck is missing some good cards because I did not have enough copies of them. I would like to play four `Retain
  the Quick Blood` copies, and also add `Ghouls of Plaza Morería`. The ally would make an excellent addition because
  it helps to soften vampires for combat, as well as give the deck some blood gaining capability. More ways to gain
  blood would definitely not hurt.
