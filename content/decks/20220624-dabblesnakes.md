    Midcap Ministry stealth-bleed deck that uses copious unlock capabilities
    in the form of Dabbler and Crimeth, Inc. to become Barons, play impactful
    political actions, defend and bloat after they all consistently bleed for
    three on stealth.

The Ministry got some sweet new toys in the 5th edition discipline revamp. `The
Platinum Protocol` gave them a consistent stealth bleed capability on a
single card, which can be made more potent with `Revelation of the Serpent`
efficiently. A deck with a stealth-bleed backbone using these two cards can
also use several multiact options, most of which are also very efficient. The
Revelation modifier itself can unlock the bleeding vampire for the cost
of burning two corruption counters, conveniently placed on minions by the
Protocol. The latter card alone enables `Dabbler`, which *also* has a second
blood-gaining mode when there is no utility in unlocking after the first action.
Lastly, anarch vampires with Protean have access to `CrimethInc.` which unlocks
a vampire after performing a successful anarch-requiring or anarch-making
action.

The new Ministry also have a very reasonable crypt: it is possible to build a
deck crypt of good midcap vampires without using vampires with clunky
disciplines. There are two good Barons. Such crypt can easily provide three good
minions in play, all of which can spend their first action bleeding for three on
stealth, then unlocking and doing something else.

The remaining question for the stealth-bleed backbone is what should be the
*second* action (the one done after a minion bleeds first). With obfuscate and
`Opium Den`, I do not need to worry about delivery, so it can be pretty much
anything. The stealth-bleed nature of the deck has a weaker defensive side and,
unlike the dementation stealth-bleeds, does not bloat while doing its primary
job. Hence, it is probably a good idea for the second action to be something
that makes the deck more resilient. As an inspiration, Dan Gargul√°k's [tournament-winning deck](https://www.vekn.net/forum/event-reports-and-twd/79780-twd-4th-road-to-pulled-fang-11-hradec-kralove-czech-may-14th-2022)
used allies such as `Carlton van Wyk` or `Cry Wolf` to defend, `Enchant Kindred`
to bloat, and `Reckless Agitation` for more ousting power.

I decided to experiment with the Baron angle of Ministry and included `Fee
Stakes`. Access to more Barons enabled using `Bait and Switch` for bleed
defense and made political actions more reliable to pass, especially the
high-impact ones such as `Reckless Agitation` or `Revolutionary Council`.
