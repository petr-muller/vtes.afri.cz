    Midcap Ministry stealth-bleed deck that uses copious unlock capabilities
    in the form of Dabbler and Crimeth, Inc. to become Barons, play impactful
    political actions, defend and bloat after they all consistently bleed for
    three on stealth.

The Ministry got some sweet new toys in the 5th edition discipline revamp. `The
Platinum Protocol` gave them a consistent stealth bleed capability on a
single card, which can be made more potent with `Revelation of the Serpent`
efficiently. A deck with a stealth-bleed backbone using these two cards can
also use several multiact options, most of which are also very efficient. The
Revelation modifier itself can unlock the bleeding vampire for the cost
of burning two corruption counters placed on minions conveniently by the
Protocol. The latter card alone enables `Dabbler`, which *also* has a second
blood-gaining mode when there is no utility in unlocking after the first action.
Lastly, anarch vampires with Protean have access to `CrimethInc.` which unlocks
a vampire after performing a successful anarch-requiring or anarch-making
action.

The new Ministry also have a very reasonable crypt: it is possible to build a
deck crypt of good midcap vampires without using vampires with clunky
disciplines. There are two good Barons. Such crypt can easily provide three good
minions in play, all of which can spend their first action bleeding for three on
stealth, then unlocking and doing something else.

The remaining question for the stealth-bleed backbone is what should be the
*second* action (the one done after a minion bleeds first). With obfuscate and
`Opium Den`, I do not need to worry about delivery, so it can be pretty much
anything. The stealth-bleed nature of the deck has a weaker defensive side and,
unlike the dementation stealth-bleeds, does not bloat while doing its primary
job. Hence, it is probably a good idea for the second action to be something
that makes the deck more resilient. As an inspiration, Dan
Gargulák's [tournament-winning deck](https://www.vekn.net/forum/event-reports-and-twd/79780-twd-4th-road-to-pulled-fang-11-hradec-kralove-czech-may-14th-2022)
used allies such as `Carlton van Wyk` or `Cry Wolf` to defend, `Enchant Kindred`
to bloat, and `Reckless Agitation` for more ousting power.

I decided to experiment with the Baron angle of Ministry and included `Fee
Stakes`. Access to more Barons enabled using `Bait and Switch` for bleed
defense and made political actions more reliable to pass, especially the
high-impact ones such as `Reckless Agitation` or `Revolutionary Council`.

## Ousting

I want to directly attack my prey's pool by sustained increased bleeds at stealth;
ideally, I should do at least three such bleeds per turn. The key card for
bleeding is `The Platinum Protocol` which is a bleed for two at one stealth.
The permanent locations (`Onion Den`, `Club Illusion`, `Anarch Railroad`) allow
sustaining bleeds at stealth without spending cards. Bounced bleeds can further
increase my bleed pressure.

I want to use high-impact political actions `Reckless Agitation` and `Revolutionary
Council` as finishers. I should usually have at least two or three barons on the
table, so it is not impossible to have a vote lock, but these actions can also
be traded with other players when necessary. The `Revolutionary Council` is not
used in a Death-Star Cannon fashion because the deck does not breed well
and will rarely have more than three or four vampires. Instead, the Council
should be used to remove annoying locations and equipment from the table, with
the pool damage as a nice bonus. I want to play the Council only after the
bleeds are done, my vampires have unlocked, and there is no better "second action"
to play (or when there is some essential target to remove from the table).
`Eat the Rich` is a nice one-of that can be recurred by `Garibaldi-Meucci Museum`:
sometimes it will be good, other times not so much.

## Survivability

Having access to Barons allows me to reliably use `Bait and Switch` to bounce
bleeds, so I should prioritize always having a Baron and ensure that I either
have a wake or keep one untapped at the end of my turn. I should prioritize
having more Barons on tables with political threats: it should not be a problem
to have three Barons, which is usually enough to maintain reasonable vote power
to deal with anything other than a dedicated political predator.

`Vessel` and `Enchant Kindred` provide a modest cushion after I bring out three
vampires and pay for some master cards but rarely outbloat the more aggressive
predators.  I want to be an aggressive deck myself, so like most stealth bleed
decks, I want to keep gaining pool via ousting.

I should take any opportunity to steal a defensive ally with `Entrancement`; one
blocking Legionnaire, `Carlton van Wyk` or anything else at least minimally good
in defense plugs one of the weak spots of the deck.

## Likes

The deck likes the situation where it can race with a prey that also has no
choice but to go forward. In the ideal case, it will win the race and
oust the weakened grandprey fast afterward. When it loses the race, the six pool is
often not enough to keep the prey alive for too long because the deck can deliver
quite a lot of damage on its good turns: it can easily bleed for six
to nine and follow it up with a `Reckless Agitation`.

The modest amount of Baron titles makes the deck a medium voting power on the table.
It can usually overpower tables without a dedicated political deck, although
the lack of `Propaganda of the Deed` limits its lunge capability. On most political
tables, it should be able to broker a deal or two and avoid receiving
collateral damage from others' political actions.

I want to be fast and aggressive, so it helps when there are decks with a slower
setup on both sides of the table. Opponents who attempt to block at least
occasionally make the deck flow better by allowing it to play more cards, but
a dedicated wall deck is often a problem long-term. In such cases, it is critical
to have at least one (but better both) location that provides permanent stealth,
otherwise the deck runs out of stealth cards fast.

## Risks

To function correctly, the deck is somewhat sensitive to having access to many
cards at any moment. For each action, I need `Platinum Protocol` with either
a `Dabbler` minion or a `CrimethInc.`, possibly with one or more stealth cards,
and finally a “second action” card, such as `Enchant Kindred` or a `Fee Stake`.
I have seen failure cases where my hand got stuck with too many cards of a single
type; such cases are difficult to recover because of a lack of card flow.

V5 Ministry decks seem to be popular at the moment, and because their crypt is
so limited, the risk of contesting is high. Contesting a vampire is backbreaking.

Having played the deck for some time now, it is a low-floor, high-ceiling deck,
depending on whether I draw the high-impact master cards soon, especially
`Dabbler` and `Club Illusion`. The first one is critical, and I am convinced
the deck needs more; I would happily play four in the 80-ish cards. Having
the `Club Illusion` on the table increases ousting power but also makes it
necessary to have a blood-bloating solution, such as `Nonu Dis` or `Carfax Abbey`.
Not drawing these cards soon enough can lead to some underwhelming results.

Ministry are now recognized as primarily a stealth-bleed clan, which some preys
will backoust without remorse. Even the ones that do not will likely focus a lot
on defense. They will not overextend or leave shields down at any given moment.
This means that the first oust is usually the hardest and takes a bit of time,
giving the grandprey space to potentially dominate the table. The deck does not
have a plan B when being aggressive is not a good option: there are not that many
resource-building actions the deck can take.

Lastly, as discussed in [Survivability](#survivability), the deck only has modest
pool gain and will rarely operate with a huge pool cushion. This makes it
vulnerable to decks that can produce a significant amount of damage.

## Combat

The deck is

## Backbone Cards

- `Dabbler`: the namesake of the deck, combos with `Platinum Protocol` to enable consistent multi-act capability
- `The Platinum Protocol`: bleed for two at stealth is a basic oust mechanism, enables `Dabbler`
- `Enchant Kindred`: modest pool gain, makes it possible to play with three minions
- `Club Illusion`: significantly increases ousting power
- `Garibaldi-Meucci Museum`: recurses key cards needed at the moment, usually `Bait and Switch`, `Platinum Protocol` or `Reckless Agitation`
