title: "Banu Haqim Anathema"

draft: false

    Punishing combat deck designed to withstand and counter grindy V5 combat
    packages, such as Animalism, Dust Up and Guns or Nephandi. Bloating blood
    enables blood gain via Villein, and plenty of Second Traditions provide
    enough defense to compensate for the lack of bleed bounce. Blood denial
    pushes pushes opposing vampires into sticky situations, hopefully to get
    burned by Marisa Fletcher or Anathema.

While preparing for Grand Prix Aarhus, I searched for a deck with good answers to several decks I expected to see.
 Resilient Gangrel variants were everywhere. Nina Nilsson played an Animalism Barons deck at an earlier Grand Prix
 and later brought it to TWDA at a smaller tournament in Stockholm. I expected the Nordic scene to follow her as she is
 an influential player. It also seemed that Brujah Barons with guns and/or spamming `Dust Ups` with `Slow Withering`
 were rising in popularity. Last but not least, `Nephandi` decks are becoming really popular again.

Overall, I expected a lot of Anarchs (and Barons because their stuff is so efficient and synergistic) and a non-trivial
 amount of grindy combat. It's not the kind that locks you with `Immortal Grapple` and hits you for ten, but midcaps
 grinding out the opposition by consistently hitting for three or four per round in many combats. I remembered a friend
 who did well in a large Czech tournament a while ago with Banu Haqim, synergizing massive blood denial with `Anathema`.
 Stealing blood is an excellent counter to grinding combat; it does not care about distance or damage prevention,
 and celerity has counters to common tricks like aggro-pokes or S:CE. Rushes allow a proactive game plan, and Banu Haqim
 have enough ousting power through `Haqim's Law: Retribution` (HL:R)

Multiple Banu Haqim + `Anathema` decks appeared in recent TWDA. I mostly took the two linked ones as a foundation, not
 being a great deck builder myself. I rarely create decks from scratch, but I enjoy tuning decks to my preference.

## Ousting
I want at least three vampires, with four possible if things go well. There are only three copies of
 `Haqim's Law: Retribution` (HL:R), but the deck usually flows well, so one or two should be on the table
 in a reasonable time, allowing me to play a bruise-bleed. It is vital to deny prey's bloat opportunities like
 `Villein`. I rush large vampires quickly and drain them of blood, even if my vampires are full. It is more important
 for these vampires to not have blood, even if the `Hunger of Marduk`-drained blood overflows. `Anathema` can be treated
 as a mini `Pentex Subversion`; placing it on a blocker vampire discourages its owner from blocking everything just
 because they can. Three titled vampires are often enough to vote `Anathema` through, and cross-table allies can be
 convinced to allow it to pass, especially if they can cash the prize themselves. Other times, `Closed Session` will be
 necessary to pass it on tables full of barons.

## Survivability
There are many opportunities to bloat; I usually `Villein` down as much blood as possible and restore it easily by
 draining other vampires. I will try to hit an `Anathema` jackpot, and even if I do not, the pool from `Ashur Tablets`
 completion and `Priority Contract` add up. `Second Tradition: Domain` provides a way to block important actions. I do
 not have any way to deal with heavy bleeds except to block them, so there is a copy of `Archon Investigation`, and I
 will often rush backward once or twice to get rid of an aggressive bleeder when necessary. When a Protean bleeder such
 as Unnamed or Ministry is my predator, I prioritize `Psyche!` to shut down `Form of Mist`; its users often do not run
 that many stealth cards, so Second Traditions are often enough to block successfully.

## Likes
I find the deck quite viable in the V5 meta. Stealing blood with additional strikes is both good offense and defense
 against most V5 combat, except other blood-stealing Banu Haqim. Like most dedicated combat decks, it can tear through
 decks that pack a limited amount of combat defense, especially if that defense is not S:CE. Stealing strikes also deal
 with most of the resilient allies efficiently.
 
## Risks
Like most rush decks, it is hard to play towards a game win; it is very easy to ruin someone's game and die. It is
 crucial to select rush targets (and blocks) that suit my game plan on the given table. Killing vampires just for fun
 and opportunity rarely leads to victory.
Other players' `Ashur Tablets` can ruin the deck's game plan by denying recursion and pool gain. Most `Ashur Tablets`
 decks play three sets -- more than I do -- which means I am likely losing the race (also, it often means contesting
 `Parthenon`, which leads to green hand jams). Losing even one copy reduces recursion events to just one, in which case
  I need to adjust card management and discard more carefully. 
Aggressive bleeding or political predators are a problem. In most cases, the pragmatic defense is to kill a minion
 or two backward, especially if the grand predator is less aggressive. Titled Banu Haqim compensate for the lack
 of multi-act by playing Second Traditions to untap for blocking, which leaves them vulnerable to tapping Ravnos
 bleeders.
Early game is vulnerable to hand jams when none of the flow-enabling cards are drawn early and opponents manage to avoid
 combat, preventing me from cycling cards. In such a situation, all focus should go into kicking off the card flow
 through any means; try blocking anyone, including a deflected bleed, discard an `Anathema` to a referendum, anything
 to draw that HL:R.

## Combat
The heavy core of the combat module is stealing blood with `Hunger of Marduk` and additional strikes. It is usually not
 that important to send the opponents to torpor or to let them burn; it is often enough if they cannot efficiently spend
 blood to play cards, must hunt from time to time, or become an easy victim to cash out an `Anathema`. Simply stealing
 blood is a good defense against standard damage, such as from Animalism or gun decks. There are enough maneuvers and
 presses so that I usually control what happens in combat, but when things go wrong, there are some dodges and prevent
 cards, but only a few. Recognizing when these are important (aggravated damage...) is key, so they are not discarded
 for an inconsequential +1 bleed or blindly spent for their secondary effect.
I appreciate the variance in combat cards; variable combat is more challenging for opponents to predict, and these
 single copies of `Sideslip` or `Walk of Flame` can go a long way. They can be discarded into HL:R when not needed, but
 I am in combat often enough to play them for their effect.

## Backbone Cards
- `Kassandra Tassaki` / `Farah Sarroub`: Primary vampires. They are cheaper than `Kasim Bayar` or `Oluwafunmilayo` but
  can do everything important just as well.
- `Ashur Tablets`: Recursion is necessary for HL:R decks that play and discard many combat cards. I only found space for
  two sets, but I would not be surprised if three would be better, replacing utility masters like `Papillon`,
  `Market Square`, and that one cute `From the Sinking Ship`.
- `Priority Contract`: This is the main forward rush vehicle. Cash it in fast; it is unique, and I will draw more. I
  often want to recurse a copy or two in a Tablets batch.
- `Hunter's Mark`: Main backward rush vehicle (because contracts are better forward). Against Presence or Protean that
  S:CE denial will be crucial; use stealth or good sequencing to avoid simple block wasting it.
- `Hunger of Marduk`: Primary combat trick; avoid playing it without an additional strike unless necessary to survive
  combat. It is OK to play it to force the opponent to play an S:CE. Recursion should ensure enough copies throughout
  the game.
- `Infernal Pursuit`: Utilized as early as possible to dig to important, high-impact cards like masters or missing
  combat elements.

## Early Game
Being aggressive too fast against the prey often switches them into turtling mode, where they stop trying to do damage
 forward and focus on survival. The deck has little raw power to quickly oust such a player, so this will often lead to
 the grandprey having an easy game, which is terrible, especially if they are a resource buildup, late-game oriented
 deck. It is desirable to deprive prey's vampire of excess blood, especially if they are likely to play `Villein`,
 but not torporize them early.
Therefore, the early game should be focused on bringing the vampires out and setting up resources such as `Anathema`
 and reading the table. How likely are others to be open to deals, or do I need to get a `Closed Session`? Or are
 `Anathema` dead cards because of the massive Camarilla vote competition? 
Getting the card flow-enabling pieces like HL:R and `Parthenon` on the table is crucial. If I need to draw them, I will
 enter combats and cycle as many cards as possible, ideally with `Infernal Pursuit`, to get them.

## Late Game
It is good if someone dies fast; this is especially true if they are a deck that builds power over time. Do not worry
 about someone getting that one VP, and happily `From a Sinking Ship` that last-stand defending player's vampire.
 Blood-intensive decks are a good matchup for the late game because they work worse after I drain their blood. Focus on
 burning vampires through `Anathema`, diablerie (modern Banu Haqim are not cursed), and an occasional
 `Dr. Marisa Fletcher` trigger.

## Experience and Ideas
- Try nine `Ashur Tablets` copies, likely replacing `From a Sinking Ship`, `Papillon`, and `Market Square`
- Two to four copies of `Judgment: Camarilla Segregation`
- Use `Oluwafunmilayo` as a star vampire, likely accompanied by Auspex discipline card for Kasim and Farah, and have
  access to `Telepathic Misdirection`
