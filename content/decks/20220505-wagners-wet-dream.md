I want to bring out `Brunhilde` and a few `Valkyries`, then bleed with `Undue Influence`. Build power slowly and ideally
let the prey overextend by not doing too many aggressive actions. Let others fear protean combat and `+1 strength`
Valkyries. Bloat with `Thing` and build power by placing `Propaganda of the Deed` cards on board. Eventually, fire the
big killing politics in three-player games.

This deck is a post-V5 version of my earlier Valkyrie deck. In this new version, I replaced some cards with their better
alternatives released for Ministry, who have Presence and Protean in V5. The new version is also supposed to defend
better because V5 brought some exciting reaction cards for Gangrel (`Deep Ecology`, `Eyes of the Wild`) and
Anarchs (`Bait and Switch`, `Organized Resistance`).

I had some moderate success playing this deck (even the previous version, which I think was weaker, spending more blood
and having worse defense), and it is a fun deck to play, but I would not take it to a high-stakes tournament, it is too
janky and vulnerable for that.

## Ousting

I want to chip away prey’s pool with `Undue Influence`, increase pressure with `Club Illusion`, and a few anarch
+bleeds. Opportunistically, I can hit big with `Revolutionary Council` or `Reckless Agitation`, voted through by
Brunhilde and Propagandas. These politics can be easily discarded when the situation is not
right; `Garibaldi-Meucci Museum` can recur them later when needed.

The deck can semi-consistently bleed with multiple minions for 2-3 with stealth. Still, it cannot consistently
stealth-deliver multiple actions through permanently intercepting minions such as allies with `The Unmasking` or wall
decks. In that case, I want to try grinding the defenders down with Valkyries.

## Survivability

The deck alone is not too pool-hungry. The basic functioning squad of Brunhilde and two Valkyries costs just 16 pool.
The deck can bloat reasonably with `Undue Influence` and `Thing`, and when things go well politically,
one `Consanguineous Boon`. Larger bleeds should be bounced with `Bait and Switch`. I have a modest untap/intercept
module that I want to use to block important or annoying actions. A few Propagandas on board, together with Brunhilde’s
Baron title, help avoid becoming the dumping ground for political collateral damage and slow down outright political
predators.

The deck packs a lot of blood-gain masters because it tends to be quite blood-hungry, primarily when `Club Illusion` is
used a lot. The blood-gain tech also allows the Valkyries to engage in combat, utilizing their `+1 strength`.

## Likes

Low-pressure predators (who doesn’t, though, right?) and smaller amounts of bleeds that can be blocked and/or bounced.

## Risks

The deck depends on Brunhilde, which can be beaten down (`Secure Haven` is there to help with that), preventing me from
doing anything forward with Valkyries. Playing only three copies also means there’s a risk of missing one in the crypt,
but I like the version with just three copies because a crypt without Brunhilde will usually have `Anarch Convert`
copies that help to dig.

Ousting survival-oriented decks which never overextend is hard, especially when they bloat a lot. Except for the
political actions, the deck has a modest upper limit on the damage it can do in a single turn, so heavy bloaters are
problematic.

Another interesting weak spot is getting significant pool damage early. This can prevent the deck from smoothly playing
some expensive masters that help maintain momentum, like `Ecoterrorists` or `Carfax Abbey`. The deck only regains pool
slowly via `Thing` and `Undue Influence`.

## Combat

The deck does not want to engage in combat too much. Of course, Brunhilde needs to be protected at all costs, and in the
presence of a combat deck somewhere around, all available defense should be used to protect her: especially `Earth Meld`
. Do not forget that `Garibaldi-Meucci Museum` is also an elysium for Anarchs (can end combat between two anarchs), not
just recursion tech.

The Valkyries should not fear getting into combat in most cases. Their increased hand strike damage, combined with being
semi-expendable and a reasonable amount of blood gain tech, should grant me a blood advantage against non-combat decks
in a long game.

## Backbone Cards

- `Carfax Abbey`: efficiently replenishes the blood spent for `Club Illusion` and lost in combat
- `Club Illusion`: basically doubles the ousting power
- `Garibaldi-Meucci Museum`: allows drawing high-impact cards like `Reckless Agitation` or `Revolutionary Council` in a
  late game. I usually do not hesitate to recurse an `Undue Influence` copy to get the capability to bleed on stealth,
  basically for free.
- `Undue Influence`: main bleed delivery card, combined with bloat
- `Earth Meld`: primary combat defense
- `Revolutionary Council` and `Reckless Agitation` with `Propaganda of the Deed`: hard-hitting politics for late-game
  with a good deal-making potential

## Early Game

I want to bring out two Valkyries and a Brunhilde, depending on seating and availability of `Things`. With
enough `Things`, bring a Valkyrie first, then start running `Things` to get out Brunhilde. Having a Valkyrie soon also
allows to play Gangrel masters, so this sequence is usually preferable. In the absence of `Things`, it may be better to
influence Brunhilde first, but that should be rare. Continue to influence as many Valkyries as possible while keeping
above 10 pool. Try to smoothly and efficiently use my cards: try to land a bleed to put the `Propaganda` to the table,
or play the `Things` to get more vampires out.

## End Game

In the ideal case, I want to have at least three Valkyries (but more is better) and Brunhilde, with enough blood and a
way to get more (ideally, `Carfax Abbey`). The deck has multiple ways how to close games, depending on the opponents, so
I want to adapt accordingly (especially keep this in mind when selecting what to bring back
with `Garibaldi-Meucci Museum`):

- Some opponents will be most vulnerable to repeated bleeds for 2+ with stealth by multiple Valkyries.
- Some opponents will be most vulnerable to a recursed `Revolutionary Council`.
- Lastly, it is possible to outgrind opposing minions with Valkyries’ increased strength and good blood gain
